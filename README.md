This is a spectrum limited to the 31 bands that typical 1/3 octave graphic equalizers use. My main motivation was the DBX231s but apparently all 31-band grapchic EQs use the same bands.


The idea was to create an online tool that I would be able to use for calibration putting it in the signal chain of a computer with access to this.
