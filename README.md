This is a spectrum generator limited to 31 bands as typical 1/3 octave graphic equalizers use. Main idea was inspired when I got a DBX231 equalizer and wanted to make a tool I can use anywhere for clibration. 

So the idea was simple, you get microphone and a signal generator and just put the spectrum analyzer within the signal chain. It still takes some calibration, but you get a relative idea of what's going on in the corresponding frequency bands.
