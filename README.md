This is a spectrum generator limited to 31 bands as typical 1/3 octave graphic equalizers use. Main idea was inspired when I got a DBX231 equalizer and wanted to make a tool I can use anywhere for clibration. 

So the idea was simple, you get microphone and a signal generator and just put the spectrum analyzer within the signal chain. It still takes some calibration, but you get a relative idea of what's going on in the corresponding frequency bands.

You can see an example here:

although you might get some warning about the safety of the website (the SSL certificates are messed up by my host) and you might have to enable microphone input from your computer or phone.
